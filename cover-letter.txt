Dear recruiters, can you please put your headphones down and hear me out for a minute?

As a daily consumer of music and podcasts, I believe Spotify has an undeniable impact on the people in the whole world.
Spotify as a freemium service is what allows people all around the world to listen to their favorite music, cafes to have chill vibes and parties to be lit. 

As someone who can't focus on work without his headphones on, I deeply appreciate everyone contributing to the existence and maintenance of Spotify.

I used to work at a digital web advertising platform company, and when I saw this job posting my eyes shined with delight.

I have extensive web development experience and a deep understanding of the mechanism of digital advertising. I am also familiar with the scale of work. All of these I believe can give me a headstart in fitting in this position.
To be able to put this experience and passion into solving problems for my favorite application and improving its access to the users around the world is the dream.

I impatiently look forward to hearing from you.
