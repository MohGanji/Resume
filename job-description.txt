Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom, no matter who they are or how much they have. Using smart technology, Wealthsimple takes financial services that are often confusing, opaque and expensive and makes them simple, transparent, and low-cost. We're the company behind some of Canada's leading digital financial products, and are growing faster than ever.

Our team is reimagining what it means to manage your money. Smart, high-performing team members will challenge you to learn and grow every day. We value great work and great ideas â€” not ego. We're looking for talented people who love a fast-paced environment, and want to ship often and make an impact with groundbreaking ideas.

Weâ€™re a remote-first team and output is more important than face time, so where you choose to work is up to you â€” as long as you have internet access, you can work from anywhere in Canada. Be a part of our Canadian success story and help shape the financial future of millions â€” join us! Read our Culture Manual and learn more about how we work.

Crypto @ Wealthsimple
Our vision is to enable all Canadians to participate in and benefit from the Crypto ecosystem no matter who they are. We aspire to build a simple, safe and trusted platform that emphasizes education and provides access to all the benefits and opportunities that crypto has to offer.

We have ambitious plans for Wealthsimple Crypto, that go much further beyond our current trading platform, and are looking for ambitious individuals that can help us shape and execute that vision.

The Crypto space is constantly evolving and can be hard to keep up with. To help keep our team at the forefront of the space, the Crypto team reserves 20% of our time to prototype and dabble with new Crypto technologies in a self-directed environment.
